# CERTIORARI: Court Evidence & Research Tool for Intelligent Organization, Reasoning, And Response Integration

> *CERTIORARI is an example app for the truffle agent to invoke tools as grpc endpoints. Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own project! See [Modifying this template](#modifying-this-template) for more information.*

## Overview

CERTIORARI is an AI-powered legal strategy and motion development system designed to assist legal professionals in developing comprehensive legal strategies while maintaining privilege and work product protection. It orchestrates various tools that process information privately and maintain chain-of-thought reasoning, integrating seamlessly through a rich data schema.

## Features

- **Case Initialization**: Create new case workspaces with essential details.
- **Document Processing**: Analyze legal documents to extract key facts, dates, legal issues, evidence points, and relationships.
- **Timeline Construction**: Build comprehensive case timelines, detect causation chains, and identify gaps or conflicts.
- **Motion Generation**: Draft motions with citations, including outlines, tables of authorities, and weakness analysis.
- **Precedent Search**: Find relevant case law to support legal arguments.
- **Strategy Analysis**: Evaluate case strategies, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and recommended actions.
- **Discovery Request Generation**: Create detailed discovery requests tailored to the case's needs.
- **Opposition Analysis**: Analyze opposing counsel's strategies and past cases.
- **Outcome Prediction**: Predict potential case outcomes with risk assessments and contingency plans.
- **Client Communication**: Generate drafts for client communications, including next steps and scheduling.
- **Research Summarization**: Summarize legal research into key points, important cases, and statutory references.
- **Document Comparison**: Compare documents to find differences and similarities.
- **Scheduling**: Manage scheduling of important case events with reminders.
- **Risk Assessment**: Assess legal and non-legal risks associated with the case.

## Running the App

### On the Truffle Computer

1. Click the `+` button in the top right of the truffle computer interface and select `Add App`
2. Search for `certiorari` and select it
3. Type a prompt like `My client is suing me for $100,000. What should I do?` and start!

### On Your Local Machine

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies
2. Run `python -m certiorari` to start the app server
3. Follow the instructions in the truffle computer section above

## Modifying this Template

So this is just a starting point for you to make your own Truffle Apps. Here's the idea:

- you make tools in the `certiorari/actions.py` file
- you make the schema in the `certiorari/schema.py` file

So your project structure should look like this:

```
certiorari/
├── README.md
├── certiorari
│   ├── __main__.py
│   ├── actions.py
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── schema.py
│   └── utils.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── tests
│   └── __init__.py
...
```

but obviously modifying the names to be relevant to your project.

## Running the Tests

We have code tests and agent tests.
