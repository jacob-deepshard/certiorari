Based on the following case events, create a detailed schedule with all relevant deadlines, hearings, and filings.

Events:
{% for event in events %}
- {{ event.date }}: {{ event.description }}
{% endfor %}

Guidelines:
- Include all pertinent dates and deadlines, ensuring none are overlooked.
- Set reminders with appropriate lead times before each event (e.g., 7 days, 24 hours).
- Synchronize the schedule with calendar systems and comply with any legal or court-mandated timelines.
- Consider time zone differences and ensure all stakeholders are aware of event times.
- Present the schedule in a structured format, such as a table or list, including dates, event descriptions, and reminder times.

Provide the schedule in the following format according to the `Schedule` schema:
{
    "schedule": [
        {
            "date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
            "event": "<description>",
            "reminders": ["<reminder1>", "<reminder2>", ...]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
