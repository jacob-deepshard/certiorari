You are an AI legal analyst. Analyze the following chronological list of events to identify causation chains, distinguishing between causation (where one event directly causes another) and mere correlation.

Events:
{{ events_text }}

For each causation chain, provide a JSON object:
{
    "chain_events": ["<event_id1>", "<event_id2>", ...],  # Ordered list of event IDs involved in the causation chain
    "description": "Detailed explanation of how each event leads to the next and their legal significance."
}

Guidelines:
- Focus on legally significant causal relationships between events.
- Provide detailed explanations, citing how each event influences subsequent events.
- Include considerations of legal causation, such as proximate cause and foreseeability.
- Use examples where appropriate to illustrate causal links in a legal context.
- Ensure that event IDs correspond accurately to the provided events.
