Case Details:
{{ case_details }}

Guidelines:
- Identify both legal risks (e.g., unfavorable precedents, procedural issues) and non-legal risks (e.g., reputational damage, financial implications).
- For each risk, assign a probability level (high, medium, low) based on available data.
- Assess the potential impact of each risk on the case outcome and client interests.
- Propose realistic and actionable mitigation plans for each identified risk.
- Document and justify all assessments clearly.

Provide your assessment in the following format according to the `RiskAssessment` schema:
{
    "identified_risks": [
        {
            "risk": "<description>",
            "probability": "<high/medium/low>",
            "impact": "<assessment>",
            "mitigation_plan": "<plan>"
        },
        ...
    ]
